# Robotik_Arm
## ü§î What's this and why?
This was a _**school project**_ made by Sami and Yashveen and we are freshmen. We wanted to do something interesting and hard at the same time (but not something impossible neither!). We like anything that can be remote controlled, so we got the idea of a robotic arm. We knew that it would not be easy to either build (create the 3D pieces, find the right mechanical solutions and also to actually assembling the whole thing) and to code it (and manage all the different motors at the same time).

We chose it, we stuck with it and we tried our best!

## ‚úèÔ∏è The 3D modeling
We costume made every single part of this arm. It was certainly not easy but it was the easier part of the project for sure. 

A few examples here :

Probably the biggest problem we had to face was to keep the arm clamp horizontal. We had to "double" the mechanical system and have a "dead weight" keeping it straight :

## üß∂ The wiring
We had a very big problem here : not enough power for the two big servos and the 360 rotor. In fact, we realized that the Arduino cannot deliver enough for everyone. Plus, coding with your pc while having the those big servos wired in, can cause a few problems to the pc!!! Yashveen's pc was completely fried and died after trying to code the big servos (we think that they need a resistance of at least 1500 Ohm, we don't suggest to wire them directly to the board and board to the pc or maybe we just had malfunctionning motors!).

## üí≠ Final thoughts

At the end, we only managed to make work the clamp. The robot fully assembled looks pretty good. We are looking towards making it fully functional one day.

You are free to use anything from this Github if you want to remplicate or finish it.
